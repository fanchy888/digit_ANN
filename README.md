# digit_ANN
A four layer neral network that can recongnize hand-written digits, using MNSIT training set.
## Train
The 'Train.py' implements the model using gradient descent and backpropagation with Numpy.
## Train_TF
The 'Model.py' implenments the model using Tensorflow-GPU.
The 'reload.py' reload the model and continue training.
